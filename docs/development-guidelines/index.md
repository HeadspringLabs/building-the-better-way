# Development Standards and Guidelines

The following documents capture our internal standards and guidelines for development activities -- based on the deep collective experience of our engineering staff. The content is organized based on the structure used in the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Libraries/dp/0321545613) _Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries, 2nd Edition, by Krzysztof Cwalina and Brad Abrams_. Each recommendation is prefixed with the terms `DO`, `CONSIDER`, `AVOID` and `DO NOT`. Below each recommendation is an explaination of the guidance.
