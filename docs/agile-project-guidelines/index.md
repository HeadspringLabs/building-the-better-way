# Agile Transformaion and Project Guidelines
{:.no_toc}

Companies from all industries still operate in traditional ways that are not conducive to adaptability and speed. In order to stay competitive in shifting markets, organizations are embracing Agile Transformation. It’s not just about technology—it’s a new way of thinking that impacts all aspects of the company. Agile methods drive efficiency in all domains including human capital management, procurement, and finance, as well as more traditional departments like product and manufacturing.

Within the financial industry, technologies and expectations are changing faster than ever, and with new players entering the fray, speed and adaptability are keys to maintaining industry leadership. While Agile is not a new concept, it can be the disruptor that Toyota Financial needs—driving faster results, increased quality, and customer satisfaction. Toyota can further differentiate itself from competitors by becoming a more agile organization.

Organization-wide Agile Transformation is a significant investment of time, resources, and capital. An effective Agile Transformation solution may help an organization meet the demands of the market through the incorporation of agile methodologies and transformative tools, and the institution of an evolutionary process that drives change in a fast and flexible manner. Agile improves the entire organization—but it takes a change in mindset in order to stick. 

In these pages, the focus will be on the basics of Agile, and implementing these methodologies within an organization. In addition, topics on providing guidance through common organizational challenges, such as company-wide adoption and efficient leadership of an agile team, are included to hone agile practices and make the most of an organization's Agile Transformation.
